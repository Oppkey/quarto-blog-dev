This is a heartfelt welcome to all members of the R community, from long-time readers of the original [R Views](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) to those just joining us. For years, R Views served as a source of resources, insights, and inspiration for R users. We are delighted to carry those ambitions into R Views Too on the new, Quarto-powered R Consortium blog. Our goal is that R Views Too becomes a hub for news, opinions, and stories as the landscape of R continues to grows and evolves.

R is more than code --- it’s also the people behind it. We hope this blog reflects diverse perspectives and experiences from across the community. To that end, we invite your voices to contribute and help shape this space together. If you have unique perspectives, updates, commentary, or examples of using R that you’d love to share, we want to hear from you. Please email your ideas to <rviewstoo@rconsortium.org>.

Happy Reading!
